Created a Product List and Cart Page Using React as frontend
the live link can be found here-: https://productlistreact.netlify.app/

To run the Project locally run npm install to install the dependencies and 

run npm start to start the project on local host

I have used React bootstrap for header component and basic styling of the page

I have used Faker to get dummy data to render in the page, due to which the image and description might not match
Products have been rendered in the card coomponent and contains price ,Image, rating , Add to cart etc

User can add and delete the prodduct from the cart
User can filter the product based on price,Out of stock and fast delivery
User can also sort the product based on the rating

The cart page conains the product details ans the price section, Which changes dynamically with the quantity of the product

Thanks for Viewing my Project
